# dbusviewer
An example program that demonstrates simple d-bus actions. No relation to Qt's 
"D-Bus Viewer".

Usage:
Click on "List d-bus services" to display a list of registered services on the 
session d-bus.

To get more information about a particular service, select the entire line in 
the results text box, copy it, and then paste it in the left text box in the 
"Keyword search" group. Then click "Query". It's ok if there is whitespace 
after the service name, because it's discarded. This makes it quick and easy to 
select a service and query it.
